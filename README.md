# BitTools: Pipeline Tools for Blender
## Installation
The correct way to use BitTools is by using it alongside Git, instead of the regular .zip file that you install using Blender itself. This is because by creating a Clone of this repository you can update the plugin by just doing a Git Pull in your Client. Let's do it

### Get a Git Client
Our studio uses Git Fork https://git-fork.com/, but you can use any client that you want, another good one is GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/. But sincerely, Fork is the easiest and most friendly client out there.

- Install Git Fork
- Create a GitHub Account

### Clone the Repo

First click on Clone use HTTPS or SSH (if you know how), then click on the copy button to copy the Repository's URL.

Notice how Fork automatically puts the Repo's URL in the first field.

Put your repository in the following folder:
C:\Users\YOURUSER\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\3.1\scripts\addons\
You can acess it more easily by typing %appdata% in the file explorer bar.

In the Name field you'll put: BitTools (This will put the repo in the BitTools folder)

Input any Login and Password or authenticate anything that might be prompted.

### Turn on in Blender

Open Blender, go to Edit > Preferences then on the Add-ons tab you search for BitTools and Enable it!
